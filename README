This directory contains the uncorrected, bias-corrected, and final versions of both the site-level PalEON 
met drivers (Phase 1a) and regional drivers (Phase 2, formerly Phase 1b). 

Directories in /projectnb/dietzelab/paleon/met_regional/ are as follows:
1. ccsm4/ contains the copied output from the down-scaled artificial neural network procedure. 
It is simply copied over from /projectnb/dietzelab/paleon/create_met/R1i1P1/Scripts/output/ann_all/$VAR/netcdf 
(Bjorn's file processing set-up).
2. cruncep/ contains the original CRUNCEP driver data downloaded by Bjorn and used to run the ANN procedure.
3. bias_corr/ contains the bias-corrected down-scaled CCSM4 output 
4. fix_precip/ contains scripts and NADP precip data used to correct the precipitation frequency distribution 
for Phase 1a and 1b bias-corrected output
5. phase1a_met_drivers_v#/ are the various versions of met drivers produced throughout the past year - only 
the most recent version should be used, as this applies all of the relevant corrections.
6. phase1b_met_regional/ contains the final version of the regional met drivers with all corrections from 
Phase 1a applied.

The processing code steps occurred in the following order:

1. Bias-correct the CCSM4 ANN down-scaled output with bias_correct.sh, writing the files to bias_corr/regional_monthly/
2. Extract sites from regional bias-corrected files to bias_corr/regional_monthly/sites/ with bias_corr/regional_monthly/parse_sites.sh
3. Use add_met_leap.R to add leap years to February months by repeating Feb 28th.
4. Use rewrite_timestamps.R to rewrite the timestamps and to make sure they are continuous days since 0850-01-01
5. Use fix_precip/fix_precip.R (for Phase 1a) or fix_precip_regional.R (for Phase 1b) to correct the 
precipitation distributions based on the 30-year daily measured precipitation at NADP sites (fix_precip/nadp/).

Sorry that there might be extra junk in this directory other than the files you need to process this. If you have any questions, email me!
